Q: What is Spring Boot? | A: Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies the development of Spring applications by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers, and production-ready features out of the box. | Category: Spring Boot
Q: How do I create a REST API in Spring Boot? | A: You can create a REST API by using the @RestController annotation on a class and @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, or @DeleteMapping annotations on methods. Spring Boot will automatically handle JSON serialization/deserialization. | Category: Spring Boot
Q: What is dependency injection in Spring? | A: Dependency injection is a design pattern where objects receive their dependencies from external sources rather than creating them internally. Spring's IoC container manages these dependencies and injects them automatically. | Category: Spring Framework
Q: How do I configure a database connection in Spring Boot? | A: You can configure database connections using application.properties or application.yml files. Add the database URL, username, password, and driver class. Spring Boot will auto-configure the DataSource bean. | Category: Database
Q: What is JPA in Spring Boot? | A: JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification for managing relational data in Java applications. Spring Boot provides Spring Data JPA which simplifies JPA implementation with repository patterns and automatic query generation. | Category: Database
Q: How do I handle exceptions in Spring Boot? | A: You can handle exceptions using @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler annotations. Create a global exception handler class to centralize exception handling across your application. | Category: Error Handling
Q: What is Spring Security? | A: Spring Security is a powerful authentication and authorization framework for Java applications. It provides comprehensive security services including authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks. | Category: Security
Q: How do I enable CORS in Spring Boot? | A: You can enable CORS by using the @CrossOrigin annotation on controllers or by configuring a WebMvcConfigurer bean with addCorsMappings method. | Category: Web Development
Q: What is Spring AI? | A: Spring AI is a framework that provides abstractions for AI applications, including integration with various AI providers like OpenAI, vector stores, and embedding models for building intelligent applications. | Category: AI Integration
Q: How do I use vector stores in Spring AI? | A: Vector stores in Spring AI allow you to store and search documents using semantic similarity. You can use SimpleVectorStore for in-memory storage or integrate with external vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate. | Category: AI Integration
Q: What is an embedding model? | A: An embedding model converts text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning. These vectors enable semantic search and similarity comparisons between documents. | Category: AI Integration
Q: How do I configure OpenAI API in Spring Boot? | A: Configure OpenAI by setting the spring.ai.openai.api-key property and optionally configuring model parameters like temperature and max-tokens in your application.properties file. | Category: AI Integration
Q: What is the difference between @Component and @Service? | A: Both are Spring stereotypes, but @Service is semantically more specific for service layer components. @Component is a generic stereotype, while @Service indicates a service layer component. | Category: Spring Framework
Q: How do I run tests in Spring Boot? | A: Spring Boot provides @SpringBootTest for integration tests, @WebMvcTest for web layer tests, and @DataJpaTest for repository tests. Use @TestPropertySource to override configuration for tests. | Category: Testing
Q: What is Spring Boot Actuator? | A: Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features like health checks, metrics, and monitoring endpoints. It helps you monitor and manage your application in production environments. | Category: Monitoring
